                In the Python language, whitespace in a variable's name is not allowed.

                You can compensate with:

                -CamelCasing: myVar

                -Underscores: my_var (prefered Python naming conventions)
        -   feedback: You should pay attention to the name of your variable since
                Python is case-sensitive.
