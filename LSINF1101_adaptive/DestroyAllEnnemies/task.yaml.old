    You are still working on your next big game, *God of massive destruction Game Of The Century edition*, and now you need to implement a better combat system.

    For this exercice, you will need to implement three classes : ``Character``, ``Cratos`` and ``Drauf``.

    Your manager thought it was too easy with a weapon, so *Cratos* will fight with is bare fists for this exercice. So no weapons.

    ``Cratos`` and ``Drauf`` will inherit from ``Character``.

    * The ``Cratos`` class represent the player, and the ``Drauf`` is a basic ennemy.

    * The ``Character`` class will have to have the attributes ``life`` and ``attack_point``, and the functions ``attack`` and ``get_hit``.

    * The ``Cratos`` class also have an attribute ``experience`` and a ``function gain_XP``.

    * *Cratos* starts with 100 life, 10 damage and 0 experience. The *Drauf* will have its variables set with the constructor.

    * The function ``attack`` will get a ``Character`` to attack as parameter.

    * The function ``get_hit`` will reduce the ``life`` of the object by the ``damage`` indicated as parameter.

    * The function ``gain_XP`` will increase the XP of the player by the ``amount`` in parameters. Every 10 point of experience, the damage of *Cratos* will increase by 1 (the amount of XP gain can be higher than 10; be careful to take that in account)

            You have to implement the following :

            The class ``Character``

            .. code-block:: python

              #attributes
              life
              attack_point

              #functions
              attack(target)
              get_hit(damage)

            The class ``Cratos``

            .. code-block:: python

              #attributes
              experience

              #functions
              __init__()
              gain_XP(amount)

            The class ``Drauf``

            .. code-block:: python

              #functions
              __init__(life, damage)
run_cmd: ''
