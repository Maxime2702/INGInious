    Your roommate is studying in high school to become a primary school teacher. She has to teach the multiplication tables to her children in her internship.

    You're kind and you decided to help her. So you decided to create a list that return all the multiplication tables that she want.

    You have to implement a function ``mult_table(n)`` wich gives you a list of functions from 0 to n (included) that compute the multiplication table of the index.

    For exemple, you execute ``l = mult_table(5)`` and you receive a list of 5 functions (it has to be lambdas) where ``l[3]`` is a function that compute the multiplication table of 3 (``x = l[3](6)`` gives you 3*6).

    *Note: if you want to capture an outside variable for your lambda you can define a parameter that does not change. exemple: ``lambda x,y=i:x+y``*
