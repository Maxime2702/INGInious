    `Anonymous <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_(group)>`_ just hired you on the dark web for a dangerous task. They've been trying to crack a code for a few days but didn't achieve anything... yet!

    They want you to build a function that will analyze each character in a given code and determine its nature. The goal is simple, they intend to use the information you will provide to look for a pattern in the code.

    Create a function ``extract(code)`` to provide information regarding the nature of each element of the code:

    For example, when given the code ``'AeB7'`` as input the function should produce ``'vowel-up vowel-low consonant-up number'`` as output. In general :

    * Add ``number`` to the answer if the element of the code is a digit.
    * Add ``vowel`` to the answer if the element of the code is a vowel.
    * Add ``consonant`` to the answer if the element of the code is a consonant.
    * Follow it by ``-up`` if the vowel or consonant is in upper case.
    * Follow it by ``-low`` if the vowel or consonant is in lower case.

    *Example*:

    With the code ``'65AeBc7'`` the function would output ``number number vowel-up vowel-low consonant-up consonant-up number``.

       <script defer>

       bodyHeight = 0;
       function postSize() {
           if (document.body.scrollHeight != bodyHeight) {
               bodyHeight = document.body.scrollHeight;
               window.parent.postMessage({height: document.body.scrollHeight}, "*");
           }
       };
       var target = document.querySelector('body');

       var observer = new MutationObserver(postSize);

       var config = { attributes: true, subtree: true }

       observer.observe(target, config);
       $(document).ready(function(){
           setTimeout(postSize, 0);
       });
